This notebook has all my kaggle works in it. As I want to be more experienced in AI/ML, I've been spending some of my 
free time on Kaggle and playing around with datasets, and I've been learning how to preprocess data, how to scale it, 
and how to apply a machine learning model and test it against metrics. This is a set of my work. I hope you enjoy!
